      "I designed a card for 2021 Christmas. Using only the basic figures, circle and typography, I made a shape of the tree, which is the representative element of Christmas, and placed the phrase at the top that I wanted to convey to my friends. In the phrase ‘So glad to have you with me, I replaced ‘so’ with ‘sol(my name)’ to express it in a fun way."
