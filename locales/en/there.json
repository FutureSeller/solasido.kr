      "In the persistent pandemic situation, we dream of deviance. Thinking of overseas travel without a promise, I added the word ‘There’ to the word ‘Here ‘to make the phrase ‘(T)HERE’. I created graphic design elements by selecting three keywords that remind us of '(T)HERE' : Spread, Connect, and Flow. I also added fun to the design elements by graphicalizing the expanded globe and texts such as latitude and longitude.",
      "And I borrowed the lyrics of ‘Here, There and Everywhere’ from The Beatles so that I could combine both ‘Here’ and ‘There’. The gradient color represents the change in sky color between ‘Here(Seoul)’ and ‘There(Paris, New York, etc.)’. Various graphic experiments were conducted using graphic elements, text, and color."
